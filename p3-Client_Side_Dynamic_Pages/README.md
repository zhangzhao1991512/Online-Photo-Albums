# Client Side Dynamic Pages
Client-side applications impact the frontend (that is, the HTML/CSS/JS), and also the backend. Backends use REST API principles, which create a common interface (the API) used simultaneously by frontend web applications, mobile applications, internet of things (IoT) devices, etc. 

In this project, you will revise the web application that was built in P2 to become a hybrid between a single-page application and the route-based application that currently exists. This means that for some routes of your website, you will not get the entire HTML contents from the server. Instead, you will create client-side JavaScript that will fetch data in the background using AJAX, and then insert the content into the page. You will be adding a caption feature for photos, as well as a REST API in Flask that will be used by your JavaScript to dynamically create pages.
