# Make Search Engines Great Again
You have now learned enough to build a scalable search engine that is similar to commercial systems. 
So, in this project, you will build an integrated web search engine that has several features:

●	Indexing implemented with MapReduce so it can scale to very large corpus sizes
●	Information retrieval based on both tf-idf and PageRank scores
●	A new search engine interface with two special features: user-driven scoring and deep summarization.
