### Getting Started:

#### To begin the project you must clone this repository. On the top of this page there is a green "clone or download" button. Copy the github link from here. Then type the following command into your terminal: 

`git clone git@github.com:eecs485staff/p1-starter-code.git`

You should notice that the folder from git is now on your local machine, called *p1-starter-code*. You will learn more about git basics and how to use the platform in the first discussion. 

You should not push to the starter code repository. Once you have received your p1 repository, add it to your cloned repo with the following commands:

`git remote rename origin staff`

`git remote add origin <URL>`
