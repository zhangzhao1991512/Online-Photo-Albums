# Authentication and Sessions

In this project, you will continue working on the photo album website developed in project 1. However, do not touch the files in the p1 sub-directory. Make another sub-directory called p2, and copy the files from p1 into the p2 sub-directory and work on the files there. Be sure to remove the .git folder and connect to the new repo given for project 2. By the end of this programming assignment you will learn how to authenticate users and maintain sessions.
